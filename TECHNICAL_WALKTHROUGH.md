    H --> I[Notion API]
    I --> J[SMS Confirmation]
    J --> K[User Notification]
```

### Technology Stack Rationale

**Node.js + Express**: 
- ‚úÖ Great for I/O heavy operations (webhooks, API calls)
- ‚úÖ Excellent npm ecosystem for web scraping
- ‚úÖ Easy deployment and scaling
- ‚ùå CPU intensive tasks (but we can offload those)

**Twilio SMS**:
- ‚úÖ Reliable, global reach
- ‚úÖ Easy integration and testing
- ‚úÖ Reasonable pricing (~$0.0075/SMS)
- ‚ùå Vendor lock-in (but easily replaceable)

**Notion API**:
- ‚úÖ Users already live in Notion
- ‚úÖ Rich data types and formatting
- ‚úÖ Built-in collaboration features
- ‚ùå Rate limits (but manageable for our use case)

**Redis + Bull Queue**:
- ‚úÖ Reliable background processing
- ‚úÖ Job retries and failure handling
- ‚úÖ Horizontal scaling ready
- ‚ùå Additional infrastructure complexity

**Puppeteer + Cheerio**:
- ‚úÖ Handles both static and dynamic content
- ‚úÖ Can bypass basic anti-bot measures
- ‚ùå Resource intensive (but we queue this)
- ‚ùå May get blocked by sophisticated sites

---

## üí° Technical Decisions & Trade-offs

### Queue System Choice
**Why Bull + Redis?**
- Background processing prevents webhook timeouts
- Reliable job processing with retries
- Horizontal scaling capability
- Rich monitoring and debugging

**Alternative considered**: Direct processing
- ‚ùå Would timeout on slow websites
- ‚ùå No retry mechanism for failures
- ‚ùå Poor user experience

### Web Scraping Strategy
**Why Puppeteer + Cheerio combo?**
- Cheerio for fast static content
- Puppeteer fallback for JS-heavy sites
- Best of both worlds approach

**Alternatives considered**:
- Pure Puppeteer: Too slow for simple sites
- Pure Cheerio: Misses JS-rendered content
- Third-party APIs: Expensive and limited

### Data Storage Choice
**Why Notion over database?**
- Users already use Notion for CRM
- Rich formatting and collaboration
- No additional database maintenance
- Built-in UI for data management

**Trade-offs**:
- ‚úÖ User adoption easier
- ‚úÖ No UI development needed
- ‚ùå Rate limiting concerns
- ‚ùå Limited query capabilities
